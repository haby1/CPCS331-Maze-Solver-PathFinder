# Solving-Maze-in-Python

Assignment Overview: This is a group assignment focused on Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and involves writing a program and a report for solving real maze
problems. Your task is to find the path from the start state to the goal state in a
maze environment using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS)
algorithms.

Assignment Details:
1. Group Collaboration:
  * This assignment is a group project, and all group members must actively cooperate with each other.
  * Select a programming language that best suits your team's skills and preferences.
  * Each group member should be prepared to contribute to the proposedsolutions and implementation.
2. Problem Description:
  * The maze environment size is 20*20, which consists of four directions: N (North), S (South), E (East), and W (West).
  * The agent's actions involve moving in these directions (left, right, or forward).
  * The maze may contain walls (illegal states) that the agent must avoid colliding with.
  * The agent's primary goal is to find a plan that leads from the start state to the goal state within the maze.
3. Assignment Components, Formal Analysis:
* Provide a comprehensive formal analysis that includes:
* PEAS: Clearly define the Performance measure, Environment type, Actuators, and Sensors for your agent.
* Environment Type: Describe the type of environment your agent operates in (e.g., Fully observable, Partially observable, Deterministic, Stochastic, etc.).
* Formulation of the Search Problem: Present a detailed formulation of the search problem, including the initial state, goal state, state space, operators, and any relevant assumptions.
* Implement an agent program that allows the agent to navigate through a maze game environment.
* I mplement both Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms to find the path from the start state to the goal state.
